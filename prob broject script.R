#3- Distributions
#A. Assume that the weight fits a normal distribution. Find the percentage of cars having 3.4 lbs or more.
percentage = (1-pnorm(3.4,mean(mtcars$wt)))*100

#B. What is the probability of getting 18 or less manual cars using these 32 observations? Assume that the probability of getting a manual car in an infinite series of cars is equal to the probability of getting a manual car from this dataset.
pbinom(18,32,0.5)
#C. Suppose there are twelve spots in a car parking area. Each spot is suitable for five possible car types, and only one of them fits perfectly. Find the probability of having four or less spots filled with the corresponding car type if the garagist attempts to park in each spot at random.

#4- Permutations and Combinations
#A. Given that we have a number in the ternary numeral system, this number has 3 digits. Use R to find all the permutations for such number. Solve using 2 different methods.

#method 2

  result=n^r
  print(result)
}

#B. Given a set of numbers A = {1, 2, â€¦, 9}, assume you are picking 3 numbers without replacement. Find the probability that you get 3 numbers where the minimum number is 2 and the maximum is 5 using at least 2 ways. 
#method 1
probabilty = nrow(combinations(n=2,r=1))/nrow(combinations(n=9,r=3))
